Tagline: IoT-based failure prediction using Deep Learning.


Problem: Unplanned equipment downtime was causing significant operational losses in industrial settings.


Action: Engineered a predictive modeling solution utilizing TensorFlow and NumPy. I processed real-time sensor data, including vibration and temperature readings, to identify early warning signs of mechanical failure.


Result: Enabled a proactive maintenance schedule that potentially reduces equipment downtime by 20%, directly impacting operational ROI.
